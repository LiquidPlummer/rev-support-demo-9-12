Code challenges:

Two primary disciplines at work:

problem solving
    identifying a finish line - identifying a solution to a given problem
        for instance: reverse a given string

code writing
    how to turn our idea into code?
    write everything down.
    Start with defining our parameters: start and finish. What problem do we have to solve, and what info do we start with?
    If we had to reverse a string, here's what we have so far:
        I need to reverse a string
        I have a given string

    Now consider what tools we have to go from start to the finish line?
    We can view the contents of a string
    We can create new strings
    We can tokenize/segment/break apart the string into individual characters or substrings

    What are the steps to reverse a string?
    start with a blank string we can add to
    start with an iterator/cursor that helps us find the end of the string
        int i = string.length()-1
    look at the targeted letter - look at string.charAt(i) where i starts at the last character
    write that letter - concatenate the letter into the new string
    loop until i < 0, we do want i = 0 included because that is the first character in the original string






    Make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
    get bread
    fetch two slices
    get butter knife to use
    put pb on one slice with knife
    put jelly on other slice with knife
    put together with pb and j inside the bread
